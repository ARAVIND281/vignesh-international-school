        <h1> Vignesh International School EVENTS</h1><br>
        <h2>Curriculum</h2><br>
        <p>Vignesh International School recognizes that learning is a lifelong process and our curriculum accentuates on this in line with the guidelines prescribed by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) which is followed in over 9000 schools across 21 countries worldwide.</p>
        <h2>our faculty team</h2><br>
        <p>Our teachers aim to provide Knowledge, Understanding, Application, Analysis, Syntheses, Evaluation and Creation. Innovative methods are encouraged and followed for effective relationships between teaching and learning to help imbibe the different perspectives within each subject area. The students become participants in learning (not just merely securing a body of knowledge) so that their learning becomes linked to their life outside the school. The teachers view each child as a unique individual and thus seek to understand and love each one. They take seriously their responsibility to teach, encourage and when needed admonish. The faculty team is facilitated to upgrade their skills and knowledge on a continual basis.</p>

        <h2>ECA</h2><br>
        <P>Extracurricular classes are conducted in the school so that the student can nurture their inborn talents under the able guidance of professionals. The Extracurricular classes like Painting, Drawing, Classical Music, Dance, Clay Modeling, Musical Instruments provide further avenues to enable the students to enhance their artistic skills. Art Education and Work Experience are compulsory and are dealt with effectively in the non scholastic area.

            Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises. In order to face the challenges at global level, we make students to participate in ECA and CCA.</P>
